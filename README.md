## Python-Tests

Using this repo to demo/prototype some python tools, starting with streamlit. 

##### first small project consisted of developing a simple web app using streamlit and pycaret. Using the "tips" dataset from seaborn, I created a quick and dirty boosted model to execute in streamlit that will predict the tip amount as a function of various input features. The tipstry.ipynb file shows the initial build. The tipsapp.py file reflects the script to execute the actual app. Nothing fancy here, just some prototyping... excited to do more.

##### statstry.py uses the statsmodel.api to create a multiple regression model for predictions... model summary statistics are also generated in streamlit app....
